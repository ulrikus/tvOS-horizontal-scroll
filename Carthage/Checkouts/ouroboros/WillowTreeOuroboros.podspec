                   Ouroboros implements an infinitely scrolling carousel for
                   tvOS, driven by the focus engine.

                   It supports 1 or more centered items grouped into pages.

                   To use from a storyboard, set your collection view's class
                   to InfiniteCarousel and update the itemsPerPage variable.
                   DESC
